# Description: <br />
The page consists of a board of tiles (6 x 6). <br />
Every 2 tiles have the same color.<br />
Each tile is closed, so user can not see a color.<br />
The gameplay is the sequence of rounds. In each round user should select 2 tiles with<br />
the same color to make them disappear. If he selects 2 tiles with different colors then<br />
they are flipped to "closed" state, and user proceeds with the next round. The game is
considered to be over when all of the tiles are opened.
